Practical No. 10

Aim: Study and implementation of Role Based Access Control in AWS Cloud

Steps:

Step1: Open your browser and visit the AWS Free Tier Sign-Up page 👉 https://aws.amazon.com/free > Click on "Create an AWS Account".

Step2: Enter Your Details:
1.Account Information
2.AWS Account Name [MyCloudLearning]
3.Choose Account Type
4.Payment Information
5.Verify Your Identity
6.Choose a Support Plan [Free Basic Plan]

Step3: Sign in to AWS Management Console, Once logged in, ensure that you are in the correct AWS region (top-right corner).



Step4: Type "IAM" and click on IAM under Services > Roles > Create Role 


Step5: Select AWS Service & choose EC2 as the trusted entity > Next   [select role type] 

\

Step6: Select the AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess checkbox >  Next



Step7: Enter a meaningful role name, [S3_ReadOnly_Role] > Create Role at bottom of page



You have successfully created an IAM role. Now, you can attach this role to an EC2 instance or other AWS services.



Step8: In EC2 Dashboard, click on Instances (left side panel) > (blue)Launch Instances.  [Launch EC2 Instance]



Step9: Configuring EC2 Instance by selecting below things:

1.Name Your Instance under Name and Tags [MyTestEC2]
2.Scroll down to Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image - AMI) > Choose Amazon Linux 2023 (Free Tier eligible)     (will install amazon linux)
3.Under Instance Type, select t2.micro OR  t3.micro (Free Tier eligible)
4.Under Key pair (login), click Create new key pair [MyEC2Key] > RSA as (key type) > Create Key Pair and download the .pem file.
5.Under Network Settings, leave the defaults & make sure Allow SSH traffic is enabled so you can connect to the instance.
6.Under Configure Storage, keep the default 8 GiB (General Purpose SSD - gp3).


Step10: Now, you will attach the IAM role you created (S3_ReadOnly_Role) to the EC2 instance by scroll down to Advanced Details >  IAM Instance Profile (dropdown) > select S3_ReadOnly_Role > Launch Instance


Once the instance is launched, verify that the IAM role is attached

Step11: EC2 Dashboard → Click Instances (left panel) > find launched instance > click on it & open its details > In Details tab, look ‘IAM Role field’ it should show S3_ReadOnly_Role 



If the IAM role is displayed correctly, your EC2 instance has IAM permissions attached successfully.
Step12: Now, let’s connect the role to the instance and accessing S3:
1.Under Instance Details, find the Public IPv4 address  and copy it 
2.Open Command Prompt, run the command “ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip”
Replace ‘your-key.pem’ → Path to your downloaded key file
                ‘your-ec2-public-ip’ → The public IPv4 address of your EC2 instance  >  Yes



Step13: Test S3 Read-Only Access as we are connected to instance, follow below steps:
1.Run this command to list all S3 buckets in your AWS account [aws s3 ls]  -  It will successfully read the command 


Step14: Test S3 Modify Access by creating a new S3 bucket type this command [aws s3 mb s3://my-new-bucket]


You should get a permission denied error, confirming that the role only allows read access
