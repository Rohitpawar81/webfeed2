Practical No. 1

Aim :- Creating a Forensic Image using FTK Imager/Encase Imager

(1)Creating Forensic Images FTK :
Imager allows you to write an image file to a single destination or to simultaneously write multiple image files to multiple destinations.
To create a forensic image: 
1.Click File, and then Create Disk Image, or click the button on the tool bar. 



     2. Select the source you want to make an image of and click Next. 




3.Select the drive or browse to the source of the image you want, and then click Finish. 



4.In the Create Image dialog, click Add.



5.Select the type of image you want to create, and then click Next.
Note: If you are creating an image of a CD or DVD, this step is skipped because all CD/DVD images are created in the IsoBuster CUE format.



1.In the Image Destination Folder field, type the location path where you want to save the image file, or click Browse to find to the desired location. 



2.In the Image Filename field, specify a name for the image file but do not specify a file extension.

3.In the Image Fragment Size field, specify the maximum size in MB for each fragment of the image file. The s01 format is limited by design to sizes between 1 MB and 2047 MB (2 GB). Compressed block pointers are 31- bit numbers (the high bit is a compressed flag), which limits the size of any one segment to two gigabytes. 

4.Click Finish. You return to the Create Image dialog.

5.To add another image destination (i.e., a different saved location or image file type), click Add, and repeat steps 5– 10. To make changes to an image destination, select the destination you want to change and click Edit. 

6.Click Start to begin the imaging process. A progress dialog appears that shows the following: 
▪The source that is being imaged 
▪The location where the image is being saved 
▪The status of the imaging process 
▪A graphical progress bar 
▪The amount of data in MB that has been copied and the total amount to be copied 
▪Elapsed time after the imaging process began 
▪Estimated time left until the process is complete


7.After the images are successfully created, click Image Summary to view detailed file information, including MD5 and SHA1 checksums. 

8.When finished, click Close

Aim: Analyze Forensic Image
1.Click on Add Evidence Item to add evidence from disk, image file or folder.

2.Now select the source evidence type as physical drive, logical drive or image file. We have selected image file and click on next.


3.Select virtual drive image & click on open option. Select the source path and click on finish.

4.Now select Evidence Tree and analyze the virtual disk as physical disk.

Similarly to add raw  image select again add evidence item and click on image file and click on open option.
5.Click on finish.

6.Now raw images will be added as a physical drive to analyze.

Aim : Capturing and analyzing network packets using Wireshark (Fundamentals) 

1.Capturing Packets : 
Capture traffic on your wireless network, click your wireless interface.
You can configure advanced features by clicking Capture > Options, but this isn’t necessary for now.



As soon as you single-click on your network interface’s name, you can see how the packets are working in real time. Wireshark will capture all the packets going in and out of our systems.
Promiscuous mode is the mode in which you can see all the packets from other systems on the network and not only the packets send or received from your network adapter. Promiscuous mode is enabled by default. To check if this mode is enabled, go to Capture and Select Options. Under this window check, if the checkbox is selected and activated at the bottom of the window. The checkbox says “Enable promiscuous mode on all interfaces”.


The red box button “STOP” on the top left side of the window can be clicked to stop the capturing of traffic on the network.

2.Color Coding : 

Different packets are seen highlighted in various different colors. This is Wireshark’s way of displaying traffic to help you easily identify the types of it. 
Default colors are:
▪Light Purple color for TCP traffic
▪Light Blue color for UDP traffic
▪Black color identifies packets with errors – example these packets are delivered in an unordered manner.

To check the color coding rules click on View and select Coloring Rules. These color coding rules can be customized and modified to fit your needs.


3.Analyze the captured Packets:
First of all, click on a packet and select it. Now, you can scroll down to view all its details.



Filters can also be created from here. Right-click on one of any details. From the menu select Apply as Filter drop-down menu so filter based on it can be created.




Practical No. 5

Aim:- Analyze the packets provided in lab and solve the questions using Wireshark :
1.What web server software is used by www.snopes.com?
The domain name be found from host header so we will set host header column where we will see all domain name
Open Wireshark  file  open  Asksnopes.pcapng
Select any http  right click  Apply as Column

select http file  right click  follow TCP Stream


2.About what cell phone problem is the client concerned? 
Client talking about cell so we search for cell keyword in whole packets.
frame.matches “(?i)cell


In the first HTTP request cell keyword is in URL and it was about cell phone charging issue.

3.According to Zillow, what instrument will Ryan learn to play? 
frame.matches “(?i)zillow”



Open file  Export Object  HTTP  save All  select the folder to save


Open the folder  search for the file name zillow  open with browser

4.How many web servers are running Apache? 
http.response


Select http  apply as column 
http.server contains “Apache”
